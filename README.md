This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function is defined to accept a single string argument, but the code attempts to pass an array of strings. This results in a compilation error due to a type mismatch. The solution involves modifying the function or the way the array is handled to ensure type compatibility.
